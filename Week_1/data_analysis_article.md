Every Data Analyst needs to be able to perform:

\- **Data collection**: This involves gathering data from various sources, such as databases, websites, and sensors.

\- **Data cleaning**: The data collected may contain errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. Data cleansing involves identifying and correcting these issues to ensure that the data is accurate and complete.

\- **Data modelling**: This process involves selecting the appropriate statistical and computational methods to analyse the data. The data may be analysed using various techniques, such as regression analysis, clustering, and decision trees.

\- **Data visualization**: Once the data has been analysed, it is important to present the findings in a meaningful way. Data visualization involves creating charts, graphs, and other visual representations to help people understand the insights that have been derived from the data.

\- **Data reporting**: presenting the data to the shareholders and clients

There are different techniques the Data Analyst can use, the most important ones are:
\- **Exploratory Analysis** - is utilized to grasp the fundamental characteristics of a dataset. Typically employed at the initial stages of data analysis, it helps summarize key aspects, identify missing values, and validate assumptions, and it is realised through visual tools like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots are often used in this technique.

\- **Regression Analysis** - is a statistical technique aimed at understanding the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is frequently used for forecasting and analysing causal relationships. Linear regression, a common method in this category, is extensively applied in machine learning.

\- **Factor Analysis** - reduces a large set of variables into fewer, more manageable factors while preserving as much information as possible. This technique is useful in market research, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

\- **Monte Carlo Simulation** -  uses probability distributions and random sampling to estimate numerical outcomes. It is especially beneficial in risk analysis and decision-making under uncertainty.

\- **Cluster Analysis** - groups objects in clusters according to similarities to each other. This method is widely used in market segmentation, image recognition, and recommendation systems.

\- **Cohort Analysis** - is a  behavioural analytics that organises data into related cohorts, that share certain characteristics within a specified timeframe. This technique is common in marketing and customer engagement strategies.

\- **Time Series Analysis** - analysis focuses on data points collected or observed at specific intervals over time. This statistical technique is often applied in forecasting sales, economic trends, and weather patterns.

\- **Sentiment Analysis** - Also known as opinion mining, sentiment analysis uses natural language processing and text analysis to extract subjective information from various sources. It is used in social media monitoring and customer feedback.

## <a name="_pjxpk3rxat7n"></a>Tools
\- **Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets, etc.** - offer a range of features for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. They are used for simple and complex data analysis tasks.

\- **R and Python:** Both of these programming languages are widely used for data analysis due to their extensive libraries and packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, etc. (Python), and ggplot2 (R) that support statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualisation.

\- **SQL** - Structured Query Language is a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. It is used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in relational databases.

\- **Power BI/Tableau** - powerful data visualisation capabilities of both programs. They are especially valuable to represent data to the clients and shareholders (non technical), as well as for the introductory data analysis of the correlations.
